# Chore-Bot-Killer
A souped up version of Codecademy's famous Chore Bot project only this time it stars Horror movie icons!

Changes since last version:
- Corrected game mechanics. So now, if you choose a  door with Kitty, it logs as 'Win'. If you, choose a door with a killer it logs as 'Game Over'
- Commented out HTML element 'totalWins' until ready to use
